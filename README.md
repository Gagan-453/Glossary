An application which allows you to search for english meanings..
You can also search for wikipedia articles and get information about them..
This also allows you to search for synonyms and antonyms of any word..
Suggestions of new words were given in the home page..
You can get notified of meanings at every interval..
You can change interval timing in notifications tab..

There are two applications in the folder ("Glossary" and "Glossary (no cmd)").
If you want to receive notifications regarding vocabulary, you can open "Glossary", else you need to open "Glossary (no cmd)".

Thanks...
